# Code Refactor Starter

This readme contains a pre-written starter code and following instructions I refactored the code to follow semantic rules. 
I also made the website more accessable and easier to read.


Gave the title a proper name in html

Used a proper <header> and <footer> in html

Added a nav tag for the links

Added a hero tag to categorize that giant pic

Added alt to each img

Added sections and aside to categorize a segment

Selected and called sections and aside

Assigned classes and IDs to reference in CSS

deleted class in the header and footer to simply just reference without the use of a class selector

moved some CSS to be in sequential order
